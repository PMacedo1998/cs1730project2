Added a display error for when the user enters an incorrect filename. I tested a permission error with 'testy.txt', non-existing file with random strings, and a correct file with admiral.txt Also added in the panel and form extensions of ncurses. To compile and link this new one you have to add '-lform' and '-lpanel' to the linking and compliations part of the makefile, as well as the panel.h and form.h to the includes. The makefile I uploaded does so. 
Waiting for an answer to the question on Piazza about forms for text editing. Forms would make scrolling, line wrapping, and newlining alot easier, since those are built-in options for forms. 
I'll probably implement the opening read in the afternoon, and hopefully re-work the text editor into a form before Sunday Morning.
