Added a display error for when the user enters an incorrect filename. I tested a permission error with 'testy.txt', non-existing file with random strings, and a correct file with admiral.txt Also added in the panel and form extensions of ncurses. To compile and link this new one you have to add '-lform' and '-lpanel' to the linking and compliations part of the makefile, as well as the panel.h and form.h to the includes. The makefile I uploaded does so. 
Waiting for an answer to the question on Piazza about forms for text editing. Forms would make scrolling, line wrapping, and newlining alot easier, since those are built-in options for forms. 
I'll probably implement the opening read in the afternoon, and hopefully re-work the text editor into a form before Sunday Morning.

No reply on the piazza post about forms, so I went ahead and changed the text editor to forms. If we're allowed to use panels, a library bundled with ncurses, then I'd have
a hard time seeing why we couldn't use the form library since it's bundled with ncurses. Plus some other students are using so we have safety on numbers.
The text editor part of the project is essentially done, only it appears that you can't insert characters on certain words, 
or at least the test file I used. You can space all the words or break them across a new line, or even delete them, but 
strangely enough you can't insert characters into certain words, not until you've either spaced or deleted a part of them. I'll
troubleshoot that later, but I've got the text editor where it scrolls, line-wraps, newlines, and tabs, etc. So aside of that
one bug it's done. I also did the opening read from the file provided in the command-line argument.
